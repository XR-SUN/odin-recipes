        <li>Puddings and custards can get lumpy. To prevent lumpy pudding, whisk all the dry ingredients together in a saucepan. Then gradually add the milk, a little bit at a time, whisking thoroughly after each addition until the mixture is smooth. As you are bringing the mixture to a boil, continue stirring constantly. </li>
