    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Done correctly, a classic tiramisu can be transcendent. 
        A creamy dessert of espresso-soaked ladyfingers surrounded by lightly sweetened whipped cream and a rich mascarpone, 
        tiramisu relies heavily on the quality of its ingredients. 
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li> 3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>100 grams granulated sugar, divided</li>
        <li>227 grams mascarpone</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using an electric mixer in a medium bowl, whip together egg yolks and 1/4 cup/50 grams sugar until very pale yellow and about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters (or whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl. Transfer mixture to a large bowl, wiping out the medium bowl used to whip the yolks and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the medium bowl, whip cream and remaining 1/4 cup/50 grams sugar until it creates soft-medium peaks. Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it creates a soft, spreadable mixture with medium peaks. Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined.</li>
        <li>Combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish (an 8x8-inch dish, or a 9-inch round cake pan would also work here) with 1 tablespoon cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder. Top with shaved or finely grated chocolate, if desired./li>
    </ol>
